## Disclaimer (Temporary Readme file)

For the frontend, we're using components from the `shadcn/ui` library to enhance the visual appeal of the application. These components are pre-built using Tailwind CSS and are installed via `npx`.
All the components used from this library can be found in the `ui` folder (we won't modify them).

Additionally, some Tailwind CSS styling was generated with ChatGPT to ensure the final design meets our desired look.
